Hi, I'm Tuncay 👋  

I'm a systems-oriented developer with a strong interest in low-level programming,
software robustness, and statically enforced correctness.

### Areas of focus
- C and Unix systems programming
- Memory safety, correctness, and defensive design
- Concurrency and synchronization primitives
- Rust and type-driven API design
- Explicit architectures and execution models

### Background
I studied at 42, where I’ve been working extensively on low-level C projects under
real-world constraints: strict coding standards, safety requirements, concurrency,
and performance.

These projects helped me build a strong understanding of how software behaves at
runtime and how design decisions impact correctness and robustness.

In parallel, I’ve been exploring Rust deeply, focusing on designing APIs and runtimes
that maximize compile-time guarantees, make invalid states unrepresentable, and favor
explicit, predictable behavior over implicit magic.

### Current work
I'm currently working on **Helix**, a statically-typed runtime framework in Rust
exploring how compile-time knowledge can replace runtime checks, improve robustness,
and reduce overhead, while keeping a clear execution boundary and deterministic behavior.

I care about long-term maintainability, correctness, and understanding what the machine
actually does.
