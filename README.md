# Hi, I’m Tuncay 👋

I’m a systems-oriented software developer interested in building robust, explicit, and maintainable systems.

I tend to work by understanding a system first, making constraints and assumptions explicit, before moving to implementation. I’m especially interested in correctness, predictable behavior, and how systems evolve over time without losing coherence.

I’ve been interested in software and computer systems for over a decade. After several years of hands-on experimentation and personal projects, my focus today is increasingly on clarity: documentation, change management, version control, and working effectively within existing codebases and teams.

📌 **Featured work**
- **[system-design](https://github.com/tuncay-basak/system-design)** — a specification-first, baseline-driven system design template
- **[helix](https://github.com/tuncay-basak/helix)** — an experimental runtime project currently in the design and exploration phase

🧠 **Background**

Low-level programming (C, Rust), Linux, concurrency, and type-driven API design.  
Backend-oriented web development (JavaScript, TypeScript, Node.js).  
Comfortable joining existing codebases and working within established constraints.
